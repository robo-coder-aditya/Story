The one I talked about in the previous story, the person who I glaze tremendously, and it's rightly deserved, is none other than Virat "The Run Machine" Kohli
He's the greatest all format batsman to ever grace a cricket field. He is a cricketing genius. Be it ODI, be it t20, be it Test.
This guy is just the greatest in every single format, and there's no competition other than GOD himself. So yeah, undoubtedly, he is the GOAT of cricket.
Let's talk about white ball cricket first.
ODI cricket has never seen a better and more consistent batsman than him. A maestro of chasing targets, he has scored numerous centuries and half centuries, majority of them in the winning cause, and there's definitely no argument
T20 cricket is where he gets trolled because of batting slowly. But the one thing people fail to realise is that whenever the target is under 220, he becomes the most important batsman because of the way he controls the game on his own, rotating singles, setting and achieving micro targets, hitting necessary boundaries whenever requied and what not.
